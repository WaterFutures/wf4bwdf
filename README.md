# Water-Futures for the Battle of Water Demand Forecasting (wf4bwdf)

This repository contains the **Water-Futures Team implementation** of the Battle of the Water Demand Forecasting (BWDF) competition.

The Battle of the Water Demand Forecasting (BWDF) was a competition organized in the context of the 3rd Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA-CCWI) joint conference held in Ferrara, Italy in 2024 [(Alvisi et al., 2025)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/JWRMD5.WRENG-6887).

> This repository is our open-source implementation created to fulfill the Water-Futures mission of making water research tools freely available.

This repository provides an easy-to-use Python package that allows researchers to:

- **Quickly load** the competition data
- **Evaluate models** using the original competition workflow  

---
## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install wf4bwdf
```

All required dependencies are installed automatically with pip. See `pyproject.toml` for details.
The project has a minimal dependency, from Python 3.9 and pandas above 2.1 it should work.

A **lightweight implementation** of this package is also available through the [WaterBenchmarkHub](https://waterfutures.github.io/WaterBenchmarkHub/), which includes only the core functions to load data in memory and evaluate forecasts.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Load complete dataset
The function `load_complete_dataset`  provides access to **DMA inflows and weather data** from the supplementary information of Alvisi et al., (2025) and **also calendar information and other problem metadata** readily available in machine-readable format.

```python
import wf4bwdf as bwdf

dataset = bwdf.load_complete_dataset()

# Print DMA description
print(dataset['dma-properties']['Description'])

# Plot DMA 3(C) inflow
dma_c_inflow = dataset['dma-inflows']['DMA 3']
# plot the series
```

### 2. Evaluate forecasts following the competition requirements
Evaluate the forecast following the competition requirements means that the `evaluate` function works only if the forecast is a complete prediction of one the original evaluation weeks and of at least 1 DMA.
```python
import wf4bwdf as bwdf
import pandas as pd

for iteration in range(1,5):
    # Load the data for that iteration (no leak of future information) using letters instead of the numbers (e.g., 'DMA C')
    dataset = bwdf.load_iteration_dataset(iteration, use_letters_for_names=True)

    # Compute your forecast: previous week
    forecast = dataset['dma-inflows'].iloc[-168:]
    forecast.index = forecast.index + pd.Timedelta(weeks=1)

    # Evaluate the forecast
    results = bwdf.evaluate(forecast)

    # Should have returned a series with the combination 'Evaluation week', DMA, and BWDF performance indicators')
    print(results)
```
